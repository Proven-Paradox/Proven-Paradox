Greetings, I'm Proven Paradox. You can reach me on Twitter as @Proven_Paradox and on email at ProvenParadox@gmail.com.
I'm currently using Git to track my writing projects. I learned Git as part of being a software developer, and today
for various reasons that's not going to happen anymore. Might as well try to salvage something from all that, no? So
now I'm writing my stuff on Git so I can transfer between multiple computers as well as display my writing. For now, I
am working on my Story Shaper tabletop RPG system.
